# Do Not Commit or Push

**Do not run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push`** unless the user explicitly asks you to.

- The user will commit and push to GitHub themselves.
- This reduces token usage from unnecessary Git commands.
- Only run Git commands when the user specifically requests it (e.g. "commit this", "push for me").
