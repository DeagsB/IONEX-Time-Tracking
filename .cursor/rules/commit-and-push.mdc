# Commit and Push After Working

After completing code changes or finishing a task:

1. **Stage all changes**: Run `git add -A` (or stage the relevant files).
2. **Commit**: Run `git commit` with a clear, concise message that describes what was done.
3. **Push**: Run `git push` to update the remote.

Use PowerShell-compatible command chaining (e.g. `;` not `&&`). If the user has uncommitted changes from previous work, include those in the commit when appropriate. Only commit when there are actual changes to commit.
