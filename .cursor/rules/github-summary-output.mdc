# Output GitHub Summary After Completing Work

After completing code changes or finishing a task, **output a short description** that the user can attach to a GitHub PR, release, or summary.

- **Format**: Clear, scannable bullets or a brief paragraph. Include what was added, changed, or fixed.
- **Length**: A few lines to a short paragraph—enough to paste into a PR description or release notes.
- **When**: At the end of your response when you've made edits or completed a requested task.
- Do not run git commit/push or build unless the user asks; just provide the summary text for them to use.

Example style:
```
## Summary
- Added X; updated Y to do Z.
- Fixed behavior when … .
- User can now … .
```
